Arcade game for Android

## Meet Dobty
This is Dobty being excited in Unity3D's editor

Dobty is a young blob deity who wants to grow into a shiny Eminence.  
In the Portal Grounds, Dobty can feed on blessings and become shinier.  
But beware! Not all things that come through the Portal Grounds are blessings...
